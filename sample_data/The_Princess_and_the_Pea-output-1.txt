Recording by Tracy Hall Anderson 's fairy tales by Hans Christian Anderson . The real princess there was once a prince who wished to marry a princess . But then she must be a real princess . He travelled all over the world in hopes of finding such a lady . But there was always something wrong . Princesses he found in plenty . But whether they were real princesses . It was impossible for him to decide . But now one thing now . Another . Seemed to him not quite right about the ladies . At last he returned to his palace quite cast down because he wished so much to have a real princess for his wife . One evening of fearful tempest arose .

Since she had been able to feel the three little peeve . New twenty mattresses and twenty feather beds . None but a real princess . Could have had such a delicate sense of feeling . The prince accordingly made her his wife being now convinced that he had found a real princess . The three peas were however put into the cabinet of curiosities where they are still to be seen . Provided they are not lost . Wasn 't this a lady of real delicacy and if the real princess
