I would like to draw your attention this morning to the 23rd psalm  this is a portion of scripture that I am quite certain as well known to most if not all of you  Psalm 23 is probably the most familiar to God's people out of all the 150 and the soldier  it's usually one of the first scripture portions of child ever learns at the beginning of light  and at the same time it's very often the last portion quoted two or by a stint of God Drawing Near to the end of life  this is a passage of God's word that is regularly read at the bedside of a sick person I have done so many times myself and my Ministry and it is recited alphin at many a funeral service  the some sets before us the beautiful picture of the Lord as the shepherd the shepherd who guides and directs and leads his sheep  while the scripture even the book of Psalms emphasizes the truth but God's people collectively are the Sheep of his pasture for example in Psalm 100 it uses the collective pronoun we are his sheep yet this Psalm is more personal  it is the individual believer who has seen in this relationship with his Lord it begins the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want on the personal pronoun is employed through ART you see the references there to me and to my and to I  it is not only true that the Lord has a Shepherd or even that he is the shepherd but for God's child the grid Assurance is this the Lord is my shepherd  now one of the features of shepherding in the Eastern culture is the way in which the shepherd leads his sheep he walks ahead or in front of the flock to search out the best Pals for their feet and the Luscious and greenest feeding grounds  the shepherd's is seen here as leading the sheep in Green Pastures you see that in verse 2 he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures the word really is imposters of tender cross  he leads the Sheep to these Lush feeding grounds because he is their Shepherd in the word Shepherd could also be translated feeder or Pastor that's what a true Pastor is a Shepherd a feeder of the flock  in Psalm 23 therefore the shepherdess seen as one who feeds his sheep but who also leads the sheep and as the Sheep follows his Shepherd he's LED beside the Still Waters into the Green Pastures on the in Paths of righteousness  but you'll notice in the fourth verse that the shepherd also leads his sheep into the valley of the shadow of death  the Sheik is not always on the hilltop enjoying the clear and bright Sunshine sometimes the shepherd leads through valleys where there is no Sun shining and where there are Terrors and dangers of Plenty on the constant threat of molestation from wild beasts of prey  and that's the subject of verse 4  yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me you'll note that up to this point in the psalm David has been speaking all of the Lord and of his guidance on his providing but here as a sheep so to speak he is speaking to  Miss Shepherd  and he said for those of art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me  if I can speak personally here and I know you will excuse that  my experience in recent days has been that of a sheep being led through the valley of the shadow of death  and I have witnessed my father and indeed other believers being led by the shepherd through the dark Valley of the Shadow and the very same facility where my father was being cared for in the next room was a Christian lady a friend and that lady in there I had the joy of ministering to her as well as to my own God  visited her and fuck for the last time there just on Wednesday and I heard yesterday that she went to be with the Lord  mad food the Valley of the shadow of death the subject of death has been very much on my mind for obvious reasons  but I can also testify to the leading of the great Shepherd has guiding on providing and such a Time  so I want to direct your attention today to these wonderful words of the shepherd's some especially those all verse 4 and while I'm preaching to my own heart am also preaching from My Own Heart To Your Heart  and I trust the Lord will bless our meditation I want to dedicate this message to my lit departed Father William known better as Billy Hamilton has gone to be with Christ Which is far better I want you to notice some things in verse 4 with me today  in this text mention is made of a dark Passage  it's called the Valley of the shadow of death  we know that the holy land is described as a land of Hills and Valleys  and that's where David was a shepherd  and I'm sure that as a Shepherd he experienced often times different experiences Hilltop experiences Vale experiences everything was not always for him plain sailing but David had in mind here in this text one of the dark valleys in the terrain upon which he led his own sheep David was a Shepherd himself he knew very well the ways of sheep and he also had a  Shepherd's Heart and it was familiar with the task of a shepherd and what he's doing here in Psalm 23 is speaking about what God was to him  what he had been to his own flock as a Shepherd David realized God was to him what David did for his own sheep the Lord did for him as his Shepherd and sometimes as David well Mew the shepherd has to lead his sheep through Dark Places and therefore this phrase can be applied to a believers distresses  Believers have distress  they have troubles they have trials were not immune to their selections that come upon other men and there are specific and special trials that Believers have that other men do not have  but we think about a Believers distress as own the way to Glory we have dark volleys to pass through  there are trials there are times of distress the Lord Jesus said to his disciples and Zone 16 Verse 33 in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world in the world ye shall have tribulation  it's something that's going to hop you will have trials you will have troubles and Acts chapter 14 and verse 22  it says that there were those who were confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must notice that the imperative we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God  another sheep are not King on Dark Places  but they've got to go through them to get to that place where the shepherd is leading them  and so it is in our lives  if you turn with me to First Peter the first Epistle of Peter  and the chapter one  it speaks their of our Salvation them of the great hope that we have of an inheritance Incorruptible in heaven  but all of this salvation Peter says in verse 6 of chapter one wherein he greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold Temptations and none of all Temptations simply signifies different kinds of Trials  or many trials and tribulations  the word heaviness is used there it really signifies sadness or Soul dejection of mind or depression of spirits he are in heaviness  through manifold Temptations or trials and it really means being under the load of a trial  bearing that heavy load  and we know that there's always a purpose in the dark passages of life  they are deemed necessary and God's purpose for us and it is the Lord who decides by the way if we need this or that trial that is why verse 6 there talks about the knife or a season if need be  and it's not for you to decide whether you need this in your life or not it's God who decides and it is he who has decided when those Trials come upon you that it is needed God knows what we need and when we need it  if I could speak of my dad's he had many trials to face in his life not just in later life much of those things to do with his health  it did seem especially so in recent years that it had tremendous trials to endure not least the trial of losing his eyesight virtually  he had Advanced macular degeneration it seem to get very much worse until even in his latter days when it looked as though his eyes were wide open he was actually asleep  it become virtually blind that was a great trial to him  the passing of my mother but it did months or so before him was a severe trial to him and yet his attitude at the time was we will just have to face it  those were his words to me will have to face it and he did with great courage with great Fortitude by the grace of God  but I want you to notice that trial and trouble is only to return to the words of Peter for a season you see that what didn't you greatly Rejoice though night for a season that's a limited period of time not forever but for a season the Sheep has to walk through the vale  yea though I walk through the valley the psalmist says  he doesn't stay in the vale  his passing through the dark passage is not staying enough he will come out of it eventually and therefore we can say yes there are distress as to Fierce and life as a Christian but don't allow the distresses to get you down because God will bring you through them and you will look back on it all with the lights  Hebrews 12 reminds us in verse 11  now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but Grievous  nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised there by God I would say to you always has an afterword  there's always an afterword  and with the writer of that lovely hem we can say I'll Bless The Hand That guided I'll bless the heart that plumbed when throned were glory dwelleth and Emmanuel's land sometimes sometime will understand  now I believe this phrase can also apply to a Believers death as well as a believers distresses  yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death every single one of us here  we'll have to walk this dark passage unless the Lord Jesus comes for us first  because you see it is appointed unto man once to die and people live as though they're never going to die  but the reality is that death awaits us all  we're sure of it they always say don't they two things that you're sure of in this life death and taxes  will death is even more sure than taxes  you can't escape death  you can dodge the tax mom if you're so inclined and you feel like going to prison but you can't God's death  it will come as a pointed  The Book of Job says much about the Frailty of life that says much about death and I read in Job chapter 10 and the closing verses verses 20 through 22 are not my days few cease them and let me alone that I may take comfort a little before I go whence I shall not return  even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death  a land of Darkness as Darkness itself and of the shadow of death without any order on where the light is as Darkness  the Valley of the shadow of death  God used to say even recent times that he was not afraid of dying  it was the flitting that worried him  that's a good old Ulster word flipping which refers to people moving house  somebody's going to pack up and move to another place we say they're slipping  so my dad was just simply saying I'm not afraid of dying I'm just afraid of the process it's how I get there it's what's going to happen in the intervening periods  and that was something that he thought of Lights  but you know he need not have worried  because the Lord carried him through in peace  and there are many dying since have been comforted by the words of verse 4  yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me  now obviously death is not called The Last Enemy for nothing  that's what the Bible says in First Corinthians 15 The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed is death death is a sobering thing it's a solemn matter to face up to and that's perfectly natural let me say to have some foreboding when it comes to the matter of our death even as believers  each person who dies actually dies alone  the hundreds might expire at the same Moment In Time Each one passes over alone you will die alone those surrounded perhaps by family and friends as my dad was the Valley of the Shadow is dark and it's lonely forget in Truth for a Christian there is nothing to fear there's nothing to fear because the Christian the child of God will not stay in the vale but as the verse indicates will pass through  Olive they do I walk through  the valley of The Shadow  and then upwards to Glory this was uppermost in Paul's mind when he wrote in 2nd Corinthians chapter 5 about his Earthly House of this Tabernacle being dissolved he was speaking of his own body and how that he would have to leave this earth and it's a bit like taking a tent down and moving on he said we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens  he spoke a little more about that verse for of like mortality being swallowed up of life then he says in verse 6 therefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord for we walk by faith not by sight we are confident I say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord wherefore we Labour that whether  wasn't or absent we may be accepted of him now you see those words present and absent and the words and verse 6 at home those words and verse 6 at home  are the Sim in the Greek as the word that's translated in verse 8 and verse 9 present  so verse it could be read like this we're confident I say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord  at home with the Lord  I have to say one of the hardest things for me this past couple of weeks has been staying in my dad's home  it was my mother's home as well obviously and there are a lot of her things still there all the dishes are hers all the stuff in the house  it's hers  the ornaments everything belonged to them both his clothes are there his shoes are there all those little bits and pieces are there and it's really hard to look at those things and the think that he's not there but the Supreme thought that was in my mind this last couple of weeks was this was their home but not a house  it's not a homeless a house  because there's gone to the real home  the final home at home with the Lord  what a wonderful thing it is to realize that sudden death as sudden Glory  that's what Paul was teaching here in verse 6 of second Corinthians 5  we're confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord but in verse it were willing to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord you look and not verse as closely as you come for purgatory and you'll not find it  you'll not find limbo and not verse you'll not find any kind of other third States  but it's absent from the body and immediately its present with the Lord that's the way it is for the believer  sudden death is sudden glory and to return to the psalm you look carefully for David it was not you will note the valley of death  that he would walk through but the Valley of the shadow of death or what a comfort there is a knot  the Valley of the shadow of death you see death to God's child is but a shadow  for Christ has actually faced the substance and triumphed over it for us that's why in the Bible you read of people like Lazarus or people like Steven that they fell asleep that's why it talks about them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him it's not talking about Soul sleep which is a heresy it's talking about those whose bodies are asleep in the Earth  what's our what's the Lord  but that analogy is a beautiful one  when David had served his own Generation by the will of God he fell on sleep he just went to sleep  nothing to fear and not you know what it's like when you fall asleep it happens before you know it  the slight Clash for the child of God and for David it was not the Valley of Death that he was passing through but the shadow of death Jesus has abolished death for his people listen to these words Hebrews chapter 2 verses 14 and 15  what has Christ done  it says forasmuch then as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage  the Lord has abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel second Timothy 1 verse 10  you know what death is like it's a bit like a bee that has had its sting removed  once that B has stung a person and has no more power to hurt others  and Paul in First Corinthians 15 and in verse 55 used that analogy of a sting when he said oh death where is thy sting  oh grave where is thy Victory The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ Christ was stung by death but neither has nothing to hurt his child in it  how do you think about a shadow  kind of Shadow hurt you  kind of Shadow hurt you  the shadow of a fearsome animal might frighten you but it can't hurt you  a dog shadow can never bite you  and the dark passage of death cannot separate the child of God from his savior on his Lord the Bible puts it like this in Romans it from verse 30th I'm persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord  yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death yes there is in this portion a dark passage in view but there is also a definite piece and that definite piece is in these words I will fear no evil  you know so many folks today live their lives in fear men's Hearts failing them for fear some people are commended by fear they live in constant fear of dying for example and some of them will stifle their fears and just try never to think about it and put it on the back burner but then it will eventually become an issue for them  fear is a terrible thing however and the Bible says that fear hath torment get I want you to notice in the psalm 23 that the psalmist did not hear any evil even the prospect of death itself because he knew the love of his Shepherd  first John chapter 4 verse 18  there is no fear in love  but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love why should a Christian be afraid to die tell me why should a Christian be afraid to die  perhaps you would say it's the ugliest thing it's the fear of the unknown because frankly none of us have ever done this before  it's the fear of the unknown isn't it  one of the Marchers I believe it was Thomasville me  was facing the prospect of being burned at the stake for his faith and he looked forward to that Prospect for some trepidation  and in his prison cell he took a candle and he held up lit candle under his finger until he could smell the flesh burning a couldn't stand it anymore at heart and he thought if I can't stand a candle on my finger I could ever go through with being burned alive at the stake  but then a fellow prisoner in the cell he was also a Christian and courage 10 with this truth he said Thomas God will not give you dying Grace until you require it  you don't need grass to die until you're dying  and so the story goes that the great man died in Victory and Triumph the next day  without fear without trepidation he went to be with his Lord  I think of another Psalm just a few on from the one that we're looking at Psalm 27 and verse 1  he says they're the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid  and in verse 3 though an host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear Christian you need fear no evil even in death for the Lord will give you his peace  my father witness to a relative from his deathbed I am ready  but you're not are you ready  on the walls ready  and Truth my dad had been ready since February 26 May 1856  because of that day at the often said through the years  he wept his way to Calvary  I have a letter here  I want to share with you  it was just sent a few days ago to my sister my oldest sister  and the lady who wrote it said I was very sorry to learn of your Dad's passing and extend to you my most sincere sympathy of him we can truly say absent from the body present with the Lord and then she gave her apologies for not being able to come to the funeral because she was going to another funeral that day
